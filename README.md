# canonical_histogram

Visualizes the output of `std::generate_canonical` in a histogram.
The bars are updated in regular intervals, so one can see the distribution progressing.
The histogram bins only show the distribution at the low and high end (i.e. 0 and up, 1 and down)

## building

The code comes with a minimal `Makefile`.
Please adjust your `CXX` environment variable as needed, or compile manually.
